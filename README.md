## Run Locally

### Environment
- Go: `go1.22.2 linux/amd64`
- Docker: `25.0.3, build 4debf41`
- Node: `v18.18.0`
- Solc: `0.8.25+commit.b61c2a91.Linux.g++`
- Abigen: `1.14.3-stable`
- [Migrate](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4) `4.17.1`

### Clone the project.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hndev2404/interview_prj
cd interview_prj
```

### Smart Contract compilation & ABI

Install sol
```bash
sudo apt-get install solc
```

Install abigen.
```bash
go install github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/cmd/abigen
```

### Compile Daemon
Very simple compile daemon for Go
```bash
go install github.com/githubnemo/CompileDaemon
```

### Deploy Smart Contract
1. Generate Go binding for contract.
    ```bash
    make init-contract
    ```

2. Update `.env`
    
    `BC_DIAL_CLIENT` Dial connects a client to the given URL.

    `BC_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` The account using for deploy smart contract (Owner)

    ```bash
    BC_DIAL_CLIENT=<dial client>
    BC_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=<private key>
    ```

3. Deploy smart contract
    ```bash
    make deploy-contract
    ```

    After the deploy succeed we will get address of contract in folder `./logs` with format name: `./logs/deploy_smart_contract_YYYY-MM-DD_HH:mm:ss.log`

    Copy the contract address from the terminal and paste it in .env.
    ```bash
    BC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<contract address>
    ```

    For example:
    ```log
    2024/05/16 22:00:31 Transaction has been committed!!
    2024/05/16 22:00:31 --------------------------------
    2024/05/16 22:00:31 Contract Address: 0xc2Fb27e49491ceeB451403c19b783a78F7E903dD
    2024/05/16 22:00:31 -----------------
    2024/05/16 22:00:31 Transaction Hash: 0xfd8b30e0c96b2606af207dd98b1f6fbc58514285286ca5b589ed0209c7c163a9
    2024/05/16 22:00:31 -----------------
    ```

### Start Application
1. Start Postgres & Adminer for Database
    ```bash
    make up
    ```

2. Init database
    ```bash
    make migrate up
    ```
    Or execute SQL queries directly at `migrations/init.sql` 

3. Run app on local
    ```bash
    make dev
    ```

    The application will run on `PORT` has been defined in `.env`.
